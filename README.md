In SparxSolver, to get answers from past answers with their bookworks (labels), scroll to the bottom of the page with answers, click the `Previous Answers` button, and a gallery with all your answers from the session will be shown. EVERY TIME YOU REOPEN THE APP THIS WILL CLEAR.
## Reloading wrong questions
On hovering a question, a ðŸ”„ icon will apper in the bottom right of the image. Click it, and as it flashes, it is reloading the question. It will replace the wrong (old) image in the `Previous Answers`.
## For developers
If you want to copy or use my code for a website, discord bot, or other project, please credit me and my website ([varunaditya.xyz](https://varunaditya.xyz)).<br>
To build the app, make sure node/npm/npx is installed. Then navigate to the folder's directory. Then run these in terminal:

```
npm i
cd app
npm i
cd..
npm start
```

Look at the package.json in the root directory for other commands.

## Help / Credits
If you need help, email me at me@varunaditya.xyz. If you want coding help, do the same.<br>
I coded this by myself with no help from others. If you have a fix/improvement, send a pull request.
